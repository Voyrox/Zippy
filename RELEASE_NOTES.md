This release marks Zippy's transition from Haskell to Zig, enhancing flexibility and performance. Major updates include: 
- Zippy is now built with Zig, reducing dependencies and improving compatibility.
- Build and run commands are no longer tied to Stack and GHC. Use any build system or runnable command of your choice.
- Updated README for comprehensive build, install, and configuration details.
