# Zippy: fast feedback for Haskell

Zippy is a lightweight Zig-built CLI that watches a single Haskell source file and reruns your command the moment you save. It keeps your stdout clean, logs to stderr with levels, and stays out of your way during the edit–compile–run loop.

## Quick start

```bash
# from the re-write/ directory
zig build
zig build run -- path/to/Main.hs

# or install locally
zig build install
zippy path/to/Main.hs
```

## Configuration (optional)

Zippy loads `Zippy.json` from the current working directory if it exists:

```json
{
  "delay": 1000000,
  "ignore": [],
  "cmd": "stack ghc -- {file} && {dir}/Main"
}
```

- `delay` (microseconds): debounce between change checks (default: 1_000_000).
- `ignore`: reserved for future ignore patterns.
- `cmd`: command to execute when the watched file changes. Placeholders: `{file}` (absolute path), `{dir}` (containing directory).

Generate a starter config: `zippy --generate`.

## CLI commands

- `--help` show help
- `--version` print version
- `--commands` list commands
- `--config` show config help
- `--log` log options
- `--clear` clear log (future)
- `--credits` show credits
- `--generate` write `Zippy.json`

## Features

- File watcher tuned for a single Haskell entry point
- Instant rebuild + re-run with configurable commands
- Structured, TTY-aware logging to stderr (INFO/WARN/ERROR/SUCCESS/DEBUG)
- Placeholder expansion `{file}` and `{dir}` in commands
- Zero runtime deps beyond Zig + your Haskell toolchain

## Install from source

Prereqs: Zig 0.15.2+, Haskell toolchain (stack/ghc/cabal).

```bash
cd Zippy
zig build install
```

Run locally after build:

```bash
zippy app/Main.hs
```
